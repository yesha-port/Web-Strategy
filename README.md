# Wicked and Sweet - Custom E-commerce Website

This repository contains the shopify website with a little bit of custom coding featuring a unique "pick and mix" functionality for candies. Client gave the logo and products weight, contents, suppiers as a brief. The project was initiated with minimal assets and involved creating high-quality product images, designing a user-friendly experience, and ensuring robust functionality for an engaging online store. This was a solo freelancing project with no team involvement.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Pick and Mix Functionality**: Customers can create their personalized candy mixes with few restrictions on weights and number of choices in a mix.
  - **Custom Product Images**: High-quality, creative product images were designed and integrated.
  - **Full Product Mockups**: Created from scratch, including rough images and full representations for all products.
  - **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Approach

This project was built from the ground up with no initial brief, product images, or detailed guidance:

- Designing the **information architecture** for intuitive navigation.
- Conducting **keyword research** to ensure high SEO performance.
- Creating **design options** based on their target's needs. Since the main target audiences were kids, I choose cat as a mascot and build up from the logo colors pairing it with bright gamified visuals.
- Providing a comprehensive package to the client including sample assets, design mockups, social media strategy, seo strategy, offline marketing strategy and a detailed plan of action.

## Client Communications

The communication with the client was key throughout this project. I kept them updated on progress and provided them with the following deliverables:

1. **Keyword Research and Social Media Strategy**: Identified high-performing keywords to optimize the website for search engines and social algorithms.
2. **Sitemap and Information Architecture**: A comprehensive structure for the websiteâ€™s pages and content.
3. **Sample Assets and Plan of Action**: Social media assets and marketing materials to amplify the brand's presence.
4. **Design Options**: Visual elements that capture the essence of the Wicked and Sweet brand.
5. **Client Questionnaire**: To gather the client's insights, preferences, and aspirations.
